Description: This package implements a simple hierarchical Bayesian model to 
  estimate 5hmC levels from DNA methylation information obtained from two 
  versions of the same samples. The same sample is scanned twice, once with the 
  common Bisulphite treatment, and again with an additional Oxidation step. The 
  idea behind this project is not only to estimate 5hmC, but also to find 
  5hmC-enriched sites/regions and differentially methylated probes/regions 
  all in one step.
